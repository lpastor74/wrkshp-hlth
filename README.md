# Building an API-Driven Health Data Interoperability (HDI) Platform
### A deep dive into data transformation from an EHR to FHIR APIs and beyond

The healthcare industry is in a state of rapid innovation. The CMS and ONC mandates on interoperability and FHIR have accelerated this by helping bring multiple healthcare stakeholders together in providing better access to quality health data across the board. Integration and interoperability are at the heart of this revolution. An interoperability solution goes beyond basic healthcare accelerators to provide healthcare organizations with the foundation for implementing a comprehensive API strategy. FHIR APIs expose business and healthcare delivery opportunities by aligning different applications across any healthcare enterprise. Interoperability on FHIR ignites new data monetization and healthcare delivery models that far exceed EHR integration and reveal new ROI streams for the healthcare enterprise.

In this workshop, we explore the CMS/ONC requirements, challenges, opportunities around FHIR based interoperability platforms, and how an API strategy provides more value than merely complying with guidelines. We explore how to connect to systems of record such as EMRs, EHRs, obtain data in HL7, FHIR or raw data formats, transform into canonical data models, handle FHIR data repository use cases, and use low-code integration to transform messages. We will handle various data structures and standards such as DaVinci, CARIN, etc. We also look at a template-driven approach to expose healthcare and non-healthcare APIs via an API marketplace, which can then be shared with stakeholders, observed, and monetized. 

Audience:
Healthcare technology decision-makers
Developers
Architects
FHIR, HL7 SMEs
Product managers

In this session, we will present:
- Current and new regulations around the healthcare industry 
- WSO2 Open Healthcare and its latest featuresâ€”including low-code integration, turnkey digital platform capabilities, FHIR/HL7 templates, and security/consent management 
- Interoperability with FHIR APIs
- Rapid development with healthcare accelerators and templates
- A hands on session to implement an end-to-end use case (extracting data from EHRs or other systems of record, converting to FHIR, and exposing as APIs)
- Discussion on building Longitudinal Patient Records beyond CMS-9115-F compliance
- How to avoid vendor lock-in and why you need flexible deployment capabilities 

The workshop is intended for healthcare payers and insurers, healthcare providers, hospital networks, pharmacy benefit managers, healthcare organizations, and all others serving the healthcare industry.
